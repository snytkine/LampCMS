What is Lampcms?
=================

Lampcms is the open source high-performance web program 
for creating Questions/Answers website.

This is similar, but not exactly the same as a traditional web forum. 

Question/Answer type of site is more suitable for certain types 
of online communities and customer support sites.

This program, however can easily be adapted for creating 
a general purpose discussion communities where it
 is 
not required to start a thread in a form of a question 
but simply start a discussion of any topic while others 

will be able to reply (instead of "answer") to a topic 
as well as make comments, rate topics and earn 
reputation 
based on how other users rate their topics and replies.

The program uses very flexible templating system 
with support for "themes" and mobile browsers.

The program is written in php in object-oriented style, 
making it easy for developers to add new features

by adding new classes or extending existing classes. 

The program also uses event driven design 
with the Subject/Observer pattern.

This program is very fast and can scaled to a very large size 
as well as being able to handle 
very heavy web traffic 
(thousands of requests per second is possible on a single server).


The NoSQL database MongoDB is used as a back-end storage, 
which means no matter 
how large your database is, 
the speed will always remain the same. 

There are never any database 
JOINS, all queries 
are simple selects and always executed blindingly fast.

It is also very easy to add additional database servers 
as the database grows. 

The design of MongoDB
makes it very easy to "just add another server" 
with almost no downtime.
